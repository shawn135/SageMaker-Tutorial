Overview
Amazon SageMaker Canvas is a visual point-and-click interface that expands the use of machine learning (ML) to business analysts, helping them to make business decisions without any ML experience. With SageMaker Canvas, business analysts can build ML models and generate predictions on their own. As a SageMaker Canvas user, you can import data from disparate sources; pick the target variables needed for predictions; and prepare and analyze data. Using the built-in AutoML capabilities, in just a few clicks you can build an ML model and generate accurate predictions, either single or in bulk, to assist with business decisions.
 
In this tutorial, you will learn how to use Amazon SageMaker Canvas to build an ML model that can predict the estimated time of arrival (ETA) of shipments (measured in days). You will use a dataset that contains complete shipping data for delivered products, including estimated time, shipping, priority, carrier, and origin.
